# Bandit: Level 2

## Getting out of Level 2

Well, getting in to Level 2 is already described in the "Getting Out of Level 1" section, so we will jump straight into getting the password needed to SSH into Level 3. 

So this level is even easier, they only have a file with spaces in the filename that we need to read. And to read this, we just enclose the filename in either double quotes (") or single quotes (').

So the command is: `cat "FILENAME"` and you will have your password/flag.
